Code for figures 1-3 (including supplements) in Markind et al., 2021

Most of this code is compatible with MATLAB R2012b but some of it may require MATLAB R2020a.

Download data from Data Dryad repository: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.h18931zkf, and place 'Data' folder under root directory, alongside 'Code' folder.
To run the code, first change the current folder to the root directory and run the script "set_global_variables".
To reproduce the figures run 'Main_workspace.m' in Code directory.

Note, to run the code for figure 3, data from http://dx.doi.org/10.6080/K00C4SZB is required. See further details in Main_workspace.
